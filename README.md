# kdevopen

This project has for first goal to open any project in kdevelop or kate.
it should use the project files should they be present.
or create them on the fly should they be missing.
so that, without modifying said software, we can open any random project in them.
just like Textmate, Sublime and Atom.

for flexibility, it should be made possible to use other text editing software in the future.
although project related would need to be implemented.

adding the above 3 software editors mentioned should be very easy.

then as a second goal. why not allow this to open other type of files.
such as images, etc. so that a single command can open anything.

cheers
